# BIMM-143-Project-2-FINAL
This is my BIMM 143 Bioinformatics Project 2 final Code. My scientific question is: Does the microgravity environment in space affect gene expression in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and, through differential gene expression analysis, are the expression changes permanent after returning back to standard gravity from spaceflight? And my hypothesis is: If human induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are exposed to microgravity during space travel, then the hiPSC-CMs adapt to the microgravity by developing a unique gene-expression signature; the in-flight samples have an upregulation of expression in genes related to metabolic function, and decreased expression in genes related to DNA damage and repair, in comparison to the ground control samples. If the changes in gene expression in space microgravity are temporary, then subsequent to space travel, the gene-expression patterns of the in-flight samples revert to standard-gravity expression patterns post-flight.
